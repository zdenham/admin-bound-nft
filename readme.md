# Admin Bound NFT

Soulbound tokens are cool, but sometimes users want to move their asset between wallets or burn them.

Admin bound is like soul bound, but the original minter (the "Admin") has the ability to transfer the token to whatever wallet they want at any time.

Because the admin can transfer the token whenever they want, it is impractical to sell admin bounds on secondary markets.

## Example use case

- I'm a AdminBound BAYC holder, I can't make it to AdminApeFest at NFT NYC. I can transfer my token to a friend so they can use it to get into the rager. After the party is over I can get my token back in my wallet w/o the friend's permission. Sharing this example specifically bc admin bounds don't prevent collusion.

- Anything that would normally be soulbound, but you want the ability to transfer between wallets

## Note

This is untested please don't use the contract w/o DYOR
